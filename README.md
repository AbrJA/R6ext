R6 classes
===========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wch/R6.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wch/R6)

This package contains an implemention of classes with reference semantics, and it is a simpler, faster, lighter-weight alternative to R's built-in reference classes.

Additionally, these classes are not built on S4 classes, so they do not require the methods package. They allow public and private members, and they support inheritance.
